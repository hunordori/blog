I’m interested in problems that can’t be solved by a simple restart. Engineering taught me how to think critically—how to build systems, define standards, and measure progress. I’ve moved across different fields, understanding sometimes an outsider sees what insiders can’t. I often find myself bridging gaps between people, ideas, and disciplines.

To be honest, I’m lazy in the best way: I aim to do things right the first time so I don’t have to do them again. I work deliberately and with attention to detail—never rushed, but always on time.
